## Parcellations

In this folder, you can find all existing group-level parcellations for human cortex that being used
in the paper. It should mentioning that some of the parcellations were originally available in volume-space. To 
keep our experiment consistency, we mapped all parcellations into the standard [HCP](https://www.humanconnectome.org/) fs-LR 32k template.

Belows are the brief descriptions of these cortical parcellations, which categorized into 
functional resting-state, task-evoked, and antomical parcellations. Among these parcellations, [Scheafer](https://balsa.wustl.edu/study/show/WG33),
[Arslan](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/brain-parcellation-survey/), and group [ICA](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/brain-parcellation-survey/) provide
multiple resolutions. We therefore summarized them in the sub-folders. For more details, please check out our paper.

### Functional resting-state

**1. [Yeo 7 and 17](www.freesurfer.net/fswiki/CerebellumParcellation_Buckner2011)**

One of the commonly-used cortical networks spanning both hemispheres using spectral clustering 
on group-averaged resting-state functional connectivity data. Original volume-based parcellations 
are available at [here](www.freesurfer.net/fswiki/CerebellumParcellation_Buckner2011) with 7 and 17
brain-wide clusters.

**2. [Power](https://balsa.wustl.edu/study/show/WG33)**

A functional resting-state parcellation that contains 65 regions per hemisphere derived from group-average 
resting-state connectivity.

**3. [Scheafer 2018](https://balsa.wustl.edu/study/show/WG33)**

A set functional resting-state parcellation from 100 to 1000 clusters that aligned with yeo 7 or 17 parcellations.
The group-averaged resting-sate FC was used to fit a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field method in order to generate
these cortical parcellations.

**4. [Gordon](https://sites.wustl.edu/petersenschlaggarlab/resources/)**

A commonly used functional resting-state parcellation that contains 333 regions barain-wide derived from
group-average resting-state connectivity using agglomerative-based clustering method.

**5. [Baldassano](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/brain-parcellation-survey/)**

A recent resting-state parcellation consists of 171 parcels barain-wide derived from HCP S500 group PCA output
using Bayesian modelling clustering method.

**6. [Shen](https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=51)**

A resting-state parcellation generated by leveraging both individual and group rs-FC data using spectral clustering
algorithm. The original volume-based parcellation was then mapped to surface-space with 200 clusters.

**7. [ICA](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/brain-parcellation-survey/)**

The ICA individual parcellations were generated based on HCP S500 group PCA output, and group-averaged 
parcellations were then obtained through 2-level approach using group-ICA. The proposed resolutions cover the range from 168 to 260 clusters. 

**8. [Arslan](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/brain-parcellation-survey/)**

A set of parcellations provide a range of 50 to 483 clusters. The individual parcellations derived via 
spectral clustering, and further integrated into a group parcellation using second-level clustering.

### Functional task-evoked

**9. [Yeo 2015](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/BrainmapOntology_Yeo2015)**

A task-evoked cortical parcellation using a hierarchical Bayesian model that applied to 10,449 task contrasts from 83 independent behavioural tasks.

### Anatomical

**10. [AAL](www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/tools/aal/) (Automated Anatomical Labelling)**

One of the most commonly used brain atlas based on cortical folding. After volume-based atlas mapped to surface, 
each hemisphere contains 41 parcels.

**11. [Desikan](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CorticalParcellation)**

A popular anatomical atlas, which individual parcellations derived using cortical folding; 
and group parcellation was then obtained by majority-voting. Each hemisphere has 35 parcels.

**12. [Destrieux](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CorticalParcellation)**

Another popular anatomical atlas, which individual parcellations derived using cortical folding; 
and group parcellation was then obtained by majority-voting. Each hemisphere has 75 parcels.

### Multi-modal

**13. [Glasser](https://balsa.wustl.edu/study/show/RVVG)**

A famous multi-modal group parcellation of total 360 parcels based on the combination of rs-FC and cytoarchitectonic information 
(Brodmann areas and myelin content) from 210 HCP subjects.

**14. [Fan](http://atlas.brainnetome.org/bnatlas.html)**

A multi-modal parcellation generated by using rs-FC and anatomical information from 40 HCP subjects, resulting in
a total 210 brain-wide parcels after mapping to the surface-space.


## HCP fs-LR 32k template

You can also find all necessary files of the HCP standard fs-LR 32k template for both hemispheres in the `fs_LR_32k template` sub-folder, 
including `fs_LR.32k.X.pial.surf.gii` and `fs_LR.32k.X.white.surf.gii` (white and pial surface, `X` represents left or right hemisphere) to replicate our volume
to surface mapping.
